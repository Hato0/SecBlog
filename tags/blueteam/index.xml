These tools are mainly used to get a remote session of the asset.
This remote access is known as Command and Control (C2) and can be implemented through many protocols and many technics. This channel will allow adversaries to perform lateral movement, internal discovery, exfiltration and much more.
Willing to hunt for C2 in companies and homemade networks, I&amp;rsquo;ve focused my effort into C2 over HTTP.</description></item></channel></rss>
